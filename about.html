                      With the globalization of Indian economy, vast opportunities of growth have thrown open for the computer software and hardware industry. Software being one of the largest growing sectors of the Indian economy, the department of computer engineering has been at the forefront of churning out software engineers of high caliber of technical expertise. It continues to foster and engender the innovation and breadth of vision necessary to excel in the blooming software industry.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, a lot of stress is laid on hands-on training and overall, development of the individual’s personality. The teaching and value addition program have devised keeping in view close interaction with the industry. The competence of the department is reflected in growing demands for its fresh graduates. The number of recruiting companies has multiplied many folds in the last few years.<br/><br/>

The department strives to make learning more creative, interactive and information driven by using sophisticated computer techniques. The centre would offer training and software development apart from being a support service for the faculty, students.”<br/><br/>
                        
                        <span style="font-size:120%"><strong>About Us</strong></span><br/><br/>

The Department of Computer Engineering was established in 2004-05 with affiliation to University of Pune, recognized by Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra State & AICTE, New Delhi with an initial intake of 60 students for UG Programme. Intake increased to 120 in 2006-07, and the present intake for the UG programme is 180 with an additional intake of 60 by second shift in 2010-11. We are also running Two Master programmes in Computer Engineering & Computer Networks.The student to teacher ratio is 15:1.<br/><br/>
                        
                        <span style="font-size:120%"><strong>What do we do?</strong></span><br/><br/>

The Department emphasizes on all round development of the students, to make them competent engineers. The Department has well qualified and experienced faculty members and technically competent supporting staff. Being fully residential campus a unique opportunity in terms of availability of students for 24 hours exists here. A unique model of Value Addition Programmes (VAP) is implemented to ensure project based learning (PBL). VAP has been proved to be a successful tool to bridge the gap between University curriculum and industry expectations. Presentations, Group Discussions, various competitions and technical festivals proved to be useful for life skill development of students.<br/><br/>

                        <span style="font-size:120%"><strong>How do we do?</strong></span><br/><br/>

We have taken efforts in order to get industry sponsored projects so that students get exposed to industry environment. Campus extended programs by a good number of industries has added much more learning to students. As a part of this we have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IBM, Infosys Ltd for their campus connect programmes. The efforts taken by the department with this regard are also appreciated by IBM into the national event titled as "The Great Mind Challenge 2010-11" (TGMC) were SIT is in top 30 based on quality of projects displayed by department. We are able to achieve consistent placement of students with focused placement training, starting in 3rd year itself and preparing them for placement interview. The companies visiting the college include Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, Persistent, TechMahindra, Accenture, Tata Technologies, NVIDIA , Iautix, Capgemini etc. The official students' forum of the department is "ACES", which conducts seminars, workshops, and technical events to help students improve their knowledge and develop leadership qualities. The students are encourage to do innovative projects, and participate in National and International competition.<br/><br/>
